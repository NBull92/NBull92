### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer/Tools Programmer at Ubisoft

A Tools Programmer working in the Games Industry, that specialises in C#, WPF, MVVM and Prism. 
I like to code in my free-time to enhance my skills and try new things, whether that be in C# or Android. 
I've worked for Rockstar Games on Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. 
I now work for Ubisoft on The Division.
